<p>Dataset: Unintentional injuries in Canada 2010</p>
<p>Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) is a computerized information system that collects and analyzes data on injuries to people (mainly children) who are seen at the emergency rooms of the 10 pediatric hospitals and of 4 general hospitals in Canada. CHIRPP is a unique, richly detailed database of "pre-event" injury information obtained by asking:What was the injured person doing when the injury happened?, What went wrong? and Where did the injury occur?</p>
